# Imagine a container holding multiple objects
# Collection in python is like container, which holds multiple objects 
# and provide way to access and loop through those objects

# list is used to store multiple items in single variable and is defined by square brackets
# mutable meaning, elements inside list can be changed
# declared with square brackets




# declare list of type numbers


# duplicates in list


# items by index , first and second last (last count starts with -1 and then decrease)


# replace items in list, so mutables

# insert item in list at a index, insert always take index as first argument

# append item to end

# remove item by name
# if there are duplicates, first occurence will be removed

# iterating with for loop

# looping with index and break and continue with fruit_name
# can be done using while loop and comparing index with length
